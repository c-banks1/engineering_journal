## The CET Program Description

### In the Beginning: 
Before the CET program there were few official certification programs that would be recognized at the state or federal level, though a few exceptions to that rule were the RN and CNA levels. 

In 1965 the CET program was created by the National Electronic Associations (NEA) 

Initially the adherents of the CET program were well trained prior-military who were already trained through the Labor Dept but wanted a way to show that they knew. The CET program was the obvious answer. 
The initial program was aimed for Radio and TV techs as those were the main people in the civilian electronic field but this would change. 

With that change, it became clear that more fields were opening up and that a computer technician need not understand the operation of a radio tower. The CETa exam was narrowed to accomodate that and centered around schematic assessment, soldering and electrical safety procedures. 

To confirm that technicians had specialty training, Specialty Certifications were created that stated the associate knew more than just the basics in areas from (Avionics to Radar) in the form of their own individual certifications. 

### Associate Status: 
An CET student is not an Associate until they have taken and passed the CET exam. The CET exam was created in order to facilitate a confirmation to employers that the Associate knew their stuff irrespective of formal education. 

The CET exam is not the only exam that was created around this time but it is unique in its scope which others have different purposes, CSS and CST exams being a good example of. 

### Promotion from CETa 

There are a variety of next steps from the CETa exam. You can pursue specialty certifications as was mentioned earlier, but you also can pursue the Journeyman, Senior or Master CET levels.
