(This block diagram shows the progression from identification to a finalized engineering design to correct an existing issue - This image might be useful from a high level) 

The authors separate the design process into two separate states; conceptual design and embodiment design. 
>  - The conceptual side is related to abstract considerations of an existing issue, the brainstorming surrounding it, elimination of some concepts and also all information gathering associated with the topic. 
>  - The embodiment side is the part when design and prototyping seems to start which concerns tolerances, requirements etc.

### **Ch.1 Engineering Design** 
*1.1 - Introduction*

Design generally speaking has a lot of definitions but the major idea that is overarching the concept is: 
> "A design is an intentionally created system which is created in order to address an existing problem."

There is more to it obviously but that is the main idea. A problem exists, individuals sit down to *decompose* and demystify the problem into its discrete components, the problem is analysed using a series of scientific and engineering tools, and the designers synethesis (bring together) components in a configuration that is intended to solve the issue. 

*1.2 - Engineering Design Process*

*1.2.1 - Importance of the Engineering Design Process* 

In the US, the concept of Engineering Design Process only was initially felt when the National Research Council (NRC) determined what was the source of the success in other foreign nations in the economic competition of manufacturing. The answer was not automation or low-labor costs, or at least not in and of themselves. The answer was engineering design. 

This wasn't the most obvious thing, roughly 5% total of all manufacturing cost is incurred by the activity of Design Process but the actions that 5% commits to result in influence on all the rest of the manufacturing process. 
> "You cannot compensate in manufacturing for defects introduced in the design phase." (pg. 4) 

The third area which influences competitiveness is *product cycle time* - the time taken from start to finish to create a design and put it on the shelf. 

*1.2.2 - Types of Designs*
