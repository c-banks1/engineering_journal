(This block diagram shows the progression from identification to a finalized engineering design to correct an existing issue - This image might be useful from a high level) 

The authors separate the design process into two separate states; conceptual design and embodiment design. 
>  - The conceptual side is related to abstract considerations of an existing issue, the brainstorming surrounding it, elimination of some concepts and also all information gathering associated with the topic. 
>  - The embodiment side is the part when design and prototyping seems to start which concerns tolerances, requirements etc.

### **Ch.1 Engineering Design** 
#### *1.1 - Introduction*

Design generally speaking has a lot of definitions but the major idea that is overarching the concept is: 
> "A design is an intentionally created system which is created in order to address an existing problem."

There is more to it obviously but that is the main idea. A problem exists, individuals sit down to *decompose* and demystify the problem into its discrete components, the problem is analysed using a series of scientific and engineering tools, and the designers synethesis (bring together) components in a configuration that is intended to solve the issue. 

#### *1.2 - Engineering Design Process* 
(Beginning from *The Engineer Design Process* - Ertas and Jones) 

One of the weaknesses that has occurred over time is the issue of new engineers eschewing the Design table which has come about due to the perceived lack of importance of the position relative to Analysis. This is not correct as the Design Engineer creates design while the Analysis side only assists to support the efforts of the Design. 

The loose definition of Engineering Design which has adapted overtime has also not made the difficulty any easier. The ABET defines engineering design as: 

> "Engineering design is the process of devising a system, component, or process to meet desired needs. It is a decision making process (often iterative) which the basic sciences, mathematics and engineering sciences are applied to voncert resources optimally to meet a stated objective. Among the fundamental elements of the design process are the establishment of objectives and criteria, synthesis, analysis, construction, testing and evaluation..." (Ertas et al. 1993)

The exact parameters of the design process outlined in the *Road Map to Engineering Design* shown above are dynamic and some areas may need to be repeated, altered or shuffled in the design process but generally they follow this structure: 

1. Recognition of Need
2. Conceptualization
3. Feasibility Assessment
4. Decision to Proceed / Funding Approval
5. Assignment of Organization Responsibilities / Work Breakdown Structure
6. Preliminary Design
7. Development Testing / Cost Analysis / Redesign
8. Detailed Design / Qualification Testing
9. Production Planning and Tooling Design
10. Production
11. Continued Acceptance Testing

These are the general steps in the design process we will next go into greater detail on the steps involved: 

##### *1.2.1 - Recognition of Need* 

The origin of the recognition of need can be highly varied and range from; Formal Requests, to Informal Requests, changes resulting from new legislation, etc. But the point is that a Need is determined, brought to the engineers and the process begins. The one who initiates the process can likewise vary as the request can come from an outside customer (customer service), a worker (efficiency or safety considerations), management (new product ideas), a government entity (government contracts), etc. But the point is that someone does bring up the issue with enough fervor to alter the course. 

In management or business, Newton's first law still applies and it can be very difficult to move the momentum off its existing vector. That being said, it is in this stage and the conceptualization stage that this is easiest to alter the shift the proposed project, before workload is assigned and before monetary funds are applied to the project beyond the labor of doing a soft feasibility assessment. 

To avoid reallocation of funding and training costs, the important step is to deeply understand the problem first and the need which are tied together but may not be the same thing. 

The answer is problem analysis and encouraging the deep understanding of all relavant factors in the problem. 

> - Break down the question into individual components
> - Assess each of those components and show what influence those components
> - Determine relationships

##### *1.2.2 - Conceptualization and Creativity*

Once a problem is evaluated and its dimensions are made clear, potential solutions are evaluated. 

There are a variety of ways that solutions are developed but one of the main ones are brainstorming and encouraging creative solutions. (One potential technique is to have a set period of time say fifteen minutes and have multiple members list out all possible solutions that come to mind.) 

Brainstorming outline: 
- Quantity first
- No criticism or evaluation during brainstorming phase
- Build on each other's ideas
- Set objectives 

There are multiple characteristics that lead to a solid creative mind but some of the big ones are; risk taking, challenging existing procedures, honesty and frankness and pursuing creativity. 

> "Invention is ninety-nine percent perspiration, and one percent inspiration."
>  - Thomas Edison (paraphrased)

##### *1.2.3 - Feasibility Assessment* 

Feasibility assessments are often tied together with the conceputalization stage but they are critical in the Design process to eliminate work being done to no purpose. 

The overall question to ask during the Feasibility assessment is: 
> "Can the project proceed to achieve the objective given the technical and financial constraints and with existing technology that we have on hand or can construct?"

Naturally as a project increases in size, the feasibility assessment grows in complexity and time commitment. No one wants to risk millions with faulty planning. 
Much of the feasibility assessment will revolve around cost constraints and attempting to tighten the budget for the project by reducing the cost in each area in order to meet budget requirements. 

Who to put in charge of the feasibility assessment? People with both wide and broad experience in the area but also those with direct ownership and responsibility over the project's success or failure. Sometimes or often, concerns may need to be overruled in order to achieve the objective or the time parameters of the objective. Some can even involve safety concern overrules. 


##### *1.2.4 - Establishing Objectives and Criteria* 

The time at which the project objectives and criteria are established is more fluid than one might believe, likely because establishing objectives and criteria for success is itself a commitment of sorts. Regardless, establishing these objectives is part of, either the explicit instructions, or the overall objectives (Commander's Intent). 

It is **critical** that these objectives be explicitly laid out and communicated to all members of the build team. Failure to do so can cause great losses in time and money. Recommend consistent meetings geared to establishing what is being done to achieve the objectives listed explicitly between department heads. 

Interdisciplinary coordination must be a critical component of any large project and it must be a position with authority. 

##### *1.2.5 - Synthesis and Analysis in Design Process*

Synthesis and Analysis are opposite operations in design. To Synthesize is to bring together different objects or ideas and integrate them into a larger whole for operation, while to Analyze is to break a whole down into smaller sub-catergories and examine each of them as a discrete model influenced by different components. 

Synthesis and Analysis will occur continually throughout the design process but are especially important during the early stages to create an early schematic that meets stated objectives and maintain system configuration between different categories of peoples. 

The cycles of synthesis and analysis are an iterative process which needs to be closely monitored and all prior assembly designs need to be maintained to see the development of the project. The system used for this can be as important as the actual synthesis/analysis cycle.
