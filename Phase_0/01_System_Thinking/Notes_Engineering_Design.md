(This block diagram shows the progression from identification to a finalized engineering design to correct an existing issue - This image might be useful from a high level) 

The authors separate the design process into two separate states; conceptual design and embodiment design. 
>  - The conceptual side is related to abstract considerations of an existing issue, the brainstorming surrounding it, elimination of some concepts and also all information gathering associated with the topic. 
>  - The embodiment side is the part when design and prototyping seems to start which concerns tolerances, requirements etc.

### **Ch.1 Engineering Design** 
#### *1.1 - Introduction*

Design generally speaking has a lot of definitions but the major idea that is overarching the concept is: 
> "A design is an intentionally created system which is created in order to address an existing problem."

There is more to it obviously but that is the main idea. A problem exists, individuals sit down to *decompose* and demystify the problem into its discrete components, the problem is analysed using a series of scientific and engineering tools, and the designers synethesis (bring together) components in a configuration that is intended to solve the issue. 

#### *1.2 - Engineering Design Process* 
(Beginning from *The Engineer Design Process* - Ertas and Jones) 

One of the weaknesses that has occurred over time is the issue of new engineers eschewing the Design table which has come about due to the perceived lack of importance of the position relative to Analysis. This is not correct as the Design Engineer creates design while the Analysis side only assists to support the efforts of the Design. 

The loose definition of Engineering Design which has adapted overtime has also not made the difficulty any easier. The ABET defines engineering design as: 

> "Engineering design is the process of devising a system, component, or process to meet desired needs. It is a decision making process (often iterative) which the basic sciences, mathematics and engineering sciences are applied to voncert resources optimally to meet a stated objective. Among the fundamental elements of the design process are the establishment of objectives and criteria, synthesis, analysis, construction, testing and evaluation..." (Ertas et al. 1993)

The exact parameters of the design process outlined in the *Road Map to Engineering Design* shown above are dynamic and some areas may need to be repeated, altered or shuffled in the design process but generally they follow this structure: 

1. Recognition of Need
2. Conceptualization
3. Feasibility Assessment
4. Decision to Proceed / Funding Approval
5. Assignment of Organization Responsibilities / Work Breakdown Structure
6. Preliminary Design
7. Development Testing / Cost Analysis / Redesign
8. Detailed Design / Qualification Testing
9. Production Planning and Tooling Design
10. Production
11. Continued Acceptance Testing

These are the general steps in the design process we will next go into greater detail on the steps involved: 

##### *1.2.1 - Recognition of Need* 

The origin of the recognition of need can be highly varied and range from; Formal Requests, to Informal Requests, changes resulting from new legislation, etc. But the point is that a Need is determined, brought to the engineers and the process begins. The one who initiates the process can likewise vary as the request can come from an outside customer (customer service), a worker (efficiency or safety considerations), management (new product ideas), a government entity (government contracts), etc. But the point is that someone does bring up the issue with enough fervor to alter the course. 

In management or business, Newton's first law still applies and it can be very difficult to move the momentum off its existing vector. That being said, it is in this stage and the conceptualization stage that this is easiest to alter the shift the proposed project, before workload is assigned and before monetary funds are applied to the project beyond the labor of doing a soft feasibility assessment. 

To avoid reallocation of funding and training costs, the important step is to deeply understand the problem first and the need which are tied together but may not be the same thing. 

The answer is problem analysis and encouraging the deep understanding of all relavant factors in the problem. 

> - Break down the question into individual components
> - Assess each of those components and show what influence those components
> - Determine relationships

##### *1.2.2 - Conceptualization and Creativity*

Once a problem is evaluated and its dimensions are made clear, potential solutions are evaluated. 

There are a variety of ways that solutions are developed but one of the main ones are brainstorming and encouraging creative solutions. (One potential technique is to have a set period of time say fifteen minutes and have multiple members list out all possible solutions that come to mind.) 

Brainstorming outline: 
- Quantity first
- No criticism or evaluation during brainstorming phase
- Build on each other's ideas
- Set objectives 

There are multiple characteristics that lead to a solid creative mind but some of the big ones are; risk taking, challenging existing procedures, honesty and frankness and pursuing creativity. 

> "Invention is ninety-nine percent perspiration, and one percent inspiration."
>  - Thomas Edison (paraphrased)

##### *1.2.3 - Feasibility Assessment* 

Feasibility assessments are often tied together with the conceputalization stage but they are critical in the Design process to eliminate work being done to no purpose. 

The overall question to ask during the Feasibility assessment is: 
> "Can the project proceed to achieve the objective given the technical and financial constraints and with existing technology that we have on hand or can construct?"

Naturally as a project increases in size, the feasibility assessment grows in complexity and time commitment. No one wants to risk millions with faulty planning. 
Much of the feasibility assessment will revolve around cost constraints and attempting to tighten the budget for the project by reducing the cost in each area in order to meet budget requirements. 

Who to put in charge of the feasibility assessment? People with both wide and broad experience in the area but also those with direct ownership and responsibility over the project's success or failure. Sometimes or often, concerns may need to be overruled in order to achieve the objective or the time parameters of the objective. Some can even involve safety concern overrules. 


##### *1.2.4 - Establishing Objectives and Criteria* 

The time at which the project objectives and criteria are established is more fluid than one might believe, likely because establishing objectives and criteria for success is itself a commitment of sorts. Regardless, establishing these objectives is part of, either the explicit instructions, or the overall objectives (Commander's Intent). 

It is **critical** that these objectives be explicitly laid out and communicated to all members of the build team. Failure to do so can cause great losses in time and money. Recommend consistent meetings geared to establishing what is being done to achieve the objectives listed explicitly between department heads. 

Interdisciplinary coordination must be a critical component of any large project and it must be a position with authority. 

##### *1.2.5 - Synthesis and Analysis in Design Process*

Synthesis and Analysis are opposite operations in design. To Synthesize is to bring together different objects or ideas and integrate them into a larger whole for operation, while to Analyze is to break a whole down into smaller sub-catergories and examine each of them as a discrete model influenced by different components. 

Synthesis and Analysis will occur continually throughout the design process but are especially important during the early stages to create an early schematic that meets stated objectives and maintain system configuration between different categories of peoples. 

The cycles of synthesis and analysis are an iterative process which needs to be closely monitored and all prior assembly designs need to be maintained to see the development of the project. The system used for this can be as important as the actual synthesis/analysis cycle. 

##### *1.2.6 - Organizational/Work Breakdown Structure (WBS)* 

The Work Breakdown Structure (WBS) is an organizational tool for management to distribute resources and assess what tasks need to be completed in order for the main objective to be accomplished. 

The WBS starts by assessing the problem structure for the objective and breaking it down into discrete components related to what departments will need to do what to accomplish them. 

The easiest way it seems to start this process is to start from Level 1 (highest level overview) and then break it down into overarching sections (Level 2), break those sections down into discrete projects (Level 3) and so on. 

The command structure must also be integrated into this at every level with one person overall being responsible for everything and then have delegated leadership down the different Level chains. 

Factors that apply in WBS creation: 
- Task Complexity
- Time Commitment
- Financial Requirements (and how those relate to the larger project) 
- Organizational Structure
- Contract Management
- Contractor and Customer Management
- etc.

Not everything requires the same level of stringency but rule of thumb, the more complex the project becomes and the greater number of failure vectors, the more formalized the WBS needs to be. 

##### *1.2.7 - Preliminary Design* 

The preliminary design is the first point at which concept meets detailed design. (Also called embodiment design in some areas of the world - Europe) 

The point of preliminary design is to make a design that achieves the objectives and the preliminary design should break down the requirements from system level(s) to component level(s) if possible. 

Balancing the various considerations here is important, if the requirements are too stringent it may result in ballooning costs but on the otherside if they are too lax the objective may not be achieved or be achieved badly. Interactions with contractors or suppliers is also a limiting factor here and relations between these and the main group can be a complication if bad leadership is employed here. 

The Preliminary Design is often done by a smaller detached group of interdisciplinary engineers which encourages close cooperation between these different engineers. This also tends to reduce the costs associated as the plans can work to reduce having to redo other work. 

##### *1.2.8 - Detailed Design* 

The Detailed Design is the point at which the preliminary design has individual components attached to it and it is prepared for either prototype or manufacturing production. 

The Detailed Design is a schematic or specification drawing that is (or portions of is) given to suppliers to acquire parts from. 

The components themselves are acquired from other suppliers who must be ethical, reliable and capable. A trend that shows promise is the choice to go with suppliers that have established QC programs rather than just the lower bidder. These examined suppliers tend to get enduring contracts or relationships with a company for future operations. 

The detailed design schematics are given to the manufacturing team so that they can create and package the system. Usually this is made showing a cross section of the system. A *next assembly* drawing is also provided which shows how the prior schematic integrates with the larger system. These *next assembly* drawings culminate in the *final* or *top assembly* drawings which show a finished product in addition to a Bill of Materials showing all parts involved in their pertinent information. 

The assembly drawings typically do not show dimensions, these come in the installation drawings which are more critical for integrating assemblies into larger systems. 

It is hard to state the importance of the advent of **Computer Aided Design (CAD)** in the modern period as CAD removes a lot of the complications that might be in the design process from version control to computer simulation of intended design. CAD works in concert with design engineers and prevents wasting lots of time with many different prototypes and emperical testing that is costly and time consuming. **CAM (Computer Aided Manufacturing)** is a byproduct of this. This does not mean that you do not need to know how to read these schematics, it just makes it more quick to utilize them and reduce costs. 

Despite emperical testing being less involved with CAD and CAM, that does not mean it is without utility. The process is called *Development Testing* which must be well planned and tightly controlled to avoid costs ballooning, consider using cost saving measures and clear testing requirements. This process is usually controlled by the Product Manager. 

At some point after designs begin, a configuration control board (CCB) will impose a *Design Freeze* after which point changes in design will be much more difficult to impose and formalized. This point is determined by an interdisciplinary CCB which determine the time of the freeze based on customer, cost, coordination and other metrics that they need to consider. It is good to know when this point will occur because if one doesn't, there is a good chance dificiences will be more difficult to correct. 

Cost estimation is another factor which is considered but the estimation for these parameters become more precise as time progresses through the design process. Much of the cost originates from tools and materials but labor is another big factor. 

One of the last steps in the detailed design is *Qualification Testing* which tests the product to see if it meets all design requirements. The scale of the qualification testing depends on the requirements but also on complexity of the system and if each sub-system must fulfill certain requirements. 

The next questions are about production, can the product be produced with materials and procedures that exist? 

##### *1.2.9 - Production Planning and Tooling Design*

At this point in the country, engineering manufacturing study and practices has taken a backseat to theory which is not good as 40% of design engineers are involved in production. Knowledge and experience in assembly practices, welding, foundry operations, etc. Are key for an applied engineer. 

To this effect knowledge of tools of the trade is critical. The term in the field is *Tooling* which is related to all physical instrumentation which is used to manufacture, position, measure or guide the manufacturing process. There is a subclass of tools which are called *numerically controlled* (NC) tools which can be programmed to perform certain motions, think a CNC machine. 

Sharing information with operations and manufacturing personnel is critical as they can greatly reduce costs associated with this, along with more formal analysis of these factors which is called *producibility analysis*. This culiminates in production line flow, the ordering of procedures to best achieve the production requirements with minimal costs. 

**Production Control** 
- Scheduling work
- Controlling inventory
- Comuputer Integrated Manufacturing (CIM)
- Just-In-Time (JIT) Systems (Minimal Inventory - continuous output, requires high supplier integrity and efficiency)

##### *1.2.10 - Production*

Qualification testing conclides the design process but support is still required. 
- Many problems or production corrections arise during the manufacturing process.

Issues that arise are collated by quality control personnel (static or roaming):
- Responsibility of inspectors is observe for parts or poor work practices.

##### *1.2.11 - Design for Manufacture and Assembly*

A practice that was created due to international competetion, efforts are made to reduce final production costs (which make up 70-80% of the end costs). To address this interdisciplinary teams work in *simultaneous engineering* to work at the same time. 

**Design for Manufacture and Assembly Outline:**
1. _Minimize number of total parts:_ Reduces cost, weight and complexity
2. _Use a modular design:_ Makes automation easier if products are 4-8 modules.
3. _Minimize part variations:_ Minimizes needs for specific non-standard pieces. Cost, time and complexity reduction.
4. _Multi-Functional Designs:_ Work to make pieces serve in several different ways to reduce needs for more parts (Electrical board mount, heat sink, chassis, etc.) 
5. _Multi-Functional Parts:_ Similar to modularity but have the individual parts interchangable.
6. _Fabrication Simplification:_ Avoid designs that require parts to undergo secondary processes or surface treatments.
7. _Avoid excessive use of fasteners:_ Reduces production complexity, error and cost ballooning.
8. _Minimize assembly directions:_ In a literal sense, assemble products in one direction to reduce need to work around prior assembly (i.e. Up from the z-axis)
9. _Maximize Compliance:_ Allow for as much tolerance as possible (where appropriate). Be generous with error bars.
10. _Minimize Handling:_ Use parts that are easy to handle and position for assembly, create areas where it is easy to determine where the parts go. (Big cost savings)
11. _Eliminate or simplify adjustments:_ Understand why an adjustment is required and work to redesign to negate their requirement. Adjustments on products are costly and can lend to a lot of error opportunity.
12. _Avoid Flexible Components:_ Wires and other components can be difficult to handle, using parts that are not flexible will reduce opportunity for snags. Or cover them to avoid confusion.

#### *1.3 - Other Important Design Considerations* 
##### *1.3.1 - Product Use* 

*The customer is always right* - Not really true but increasingly it is important to make products effective, safe, ergonomic, and idiot-proof. 

The frequency of litigation (sometimes apparently malicious) is often a considerable issue which can be a problem even in cases when the customer is using the product inappropriately. Consider the ways in which a product can be **mis-used** along with more traditional product use considerations. 

##### *1.3.2 - Design Life* 

Equipment is used for a particular span of time and is designed to sustain wear and tear over those time periods, consider however if equipment is extended past those or is cannabilized to serve another purpose after it has eclipsed its certified period. This is a problem in terms of litigation. Courts are concerned with *forseeable* events, not misuse. 

Also after the product has been retired, consider how it will be dismantled and either destroyed in a landfill or whether recyclable materials will be employed. 

##### *1.3.3 - Human Factors Considerations* 

Consider how user friendly the product is intended to be. Few people actually read user manuals for less obviously complicated devices, use of colors, modules and writing either on the product or elsewhere is encouraged to make the device less complicated. 

Ergonomic data integration into devices is also important. (Average length of a human arm, hand size, font size of writing, etc.) 

In ideal situations, products should act and feel like an extension of the operator, with the device not causing undue strain and maintenance being relatively simple (at least for common issues) 

#### *1.4 - Advanced Technology in Design Process* 
##### *1.4.1 - CAD/CAM* 

Production time is one of the greatest issues in the design process. The introduction of electronic communication helped this but what really changed the landscape was CAD/CAM which reduced the conflicts between the design team and the manufacturing team in a big way. 

Before, the design process was mostly sequential (outlined in 1.2) but with the advent of these softwares, design has become concurrent which has revolutionized design processes. 

Advantages: 
- Significant Cost Reductions
- Much shorter design process
- Quality improvements
- Analytical and prototyping requirements reduced.
- Design -> Manufacturing communication and vice versa significantly improved.
- Fewer ECO (Engineering Change Order) required.

More than just design CAD allows you to do analysis within the same software (Finite Element Analysis) and other software packages. 

##### *1.4.2 - Solids or Surfaces* 

CAD allows utilizing 2D or 3D space and something in between (2.5D) but these are able to be moved around and communicated between different peoples to utilize the data through the Intitial Graphics Exchange Standard (IGES). 

There are two main kinds of solid generations which is Boundary Representation (BRep) and Constructive Solid Geometry (CSG):
- BRep: Effectively stiches together different surfaces to make a larger solid (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boundary_representation)
- CSG: Uses modular designs to add and subtract from each other with logic issues (Union, Differences and Intersections) (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constructive_solid_geometry)

##### *1.4.3 - Computer-Integrated Manufacturing* 
CIM has become critical overtime for managing large amounts of information on parts and procedures and industries that use this have greatly increased productivity. 

(Document is likely out of date as it only describes events which are anticipated but have not occurred, at the time of the document) 

#### *1.5 - Design Process* 

Competition in the international sense is required in the modern day. Labor costs are the chief issue in more developed nations relative to those areas where imports are coming from, but the design process must offset this. The design process is centered around four concepts: 

DP: 
- Synthesis
- Analysis
- Material Selection
- Testing

But it is supported by different cogs of the system: 
- Reliability
- Maintainability
- Dependability
- Manufacturability
- Cost Benefit
- Availability
