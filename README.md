### Cbanks1 - Engineering_Journal Overview
**Description:** Collection of journaling and information that is segmented into Phases to describe developments in my engineering competency and associated projects. 

**Structure:** This journal is intended to be segmented into a series of *Phases* which are indexed 0 through 4. They are structured as: 

> *Phase 0 - Literacy:* This should be considered a more classic journal which describes my progression in increasing competency, anyone can read this Phase of course, but it may not be very interesting to prospective employers. The Phase will contain notes, thoughts, questions, ideas and small experiments that I may run.

*Phases 1-3* are concerned more with individual projects, these may be short to begin with or longer as time progresses, and the structure will be mimicked for each new project as it comes along. The structure follows as:
> - *Phase 1 - Abstract and Component Gathering:* This Phase will go over the Abstract concepts of the proposed project. Component selection and accompanying data sheets, rough designs using FreeCAD, lists of required activities whether they be software or hardware, time and financial considerations, etc. 
> - *Phase 2 - Prototyping and Software/Hardware Integration:* This Phase will contain Prototyping designs (more serious versions of the rough designs in Phase 0), Software and Firmware programming where appropriate, assessments of prototype version performance, etc.
> - *Phase 3 - Control and Failure Management:* This Phase will assess Stability, signal noise, stress testing and manufacturing considerations and anything else that might come to mind.
> - *Phase 4 - Project Finalization and Next Steps:* This Phase will contain the finalized hardware designs, firmware and software versions, and potential next steps to either build off the project or continue onto other projects.
